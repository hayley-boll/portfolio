# Contractor Management Analysis

**Business Issue**  
No visibility into contractor spend, data lives in multiple sources and cannot be analyzed holistically, no standard calculations across organization (sites/regions have different philisophies), business stakeholders have limited access to data, and low trust of data accuracy.

**Goals**  
1\. Visibility to enable governance and management of labor strategies  
2\. Drive accountability and ownership of labor management  
3\. Identify future opportunities for savings

**Outcome**
