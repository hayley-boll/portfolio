# Contractor Management Analysis

**Business Issue**  
No visibility into contractor spend, data lives in multiple sources and cannot be analyzed holistically, no standard calculations across organization (sites/regions have different philisophies), business stakeholders have limited access to data, low trust of data accuracy, and minimal sense of ownership from business stakeholders around contractor strategy.

# Goals & Outcomes

**Goal #1:** Visibility to enable governance and management of labor strategies  
**Outcome:** Reporting model that visualizes contractor strategy and performance against it through key metrics of `1` contract headcount, `2` overtime %, and `3` crew mix.  

**Goal #2:** Drive accountability and ownership of labor management  
**Outcome:**

**Goal #3:** Identify future opportunities for savings  
**Outcome:**

**Power BI Features** `Scheduled Refresh` `Value Parameters` `Field Parameters` `Bookmarks` `Drill Down` `Drill Through`  
**DAX** `CALCULATE` `VAR/RETURN` `SELECTEDVALUE` `NOT IN` `KEEPFILTERS` `ALLSELECTED` `SUM` `RANKX` `DIVIDE`  
**SQL** `SELECT` `FROM` `WHERE` `CAST` `CASE` `LEFT OUTER JOIN`
