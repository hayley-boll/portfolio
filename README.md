# Hayley Boll - Data Analytics Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Hayley! I am a results-driven analytics professional with a strong foundation in data analysis, visualization, and strategic decision-making. I specialize in transforming complex data into actionable insights that drive business performance. Proficient in tools such as Power BI, Excel, and SQL, I am adept at developing interactive dashboards, conducting in-depth analyses, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to implement data-driven solutions. My passion lies in leveraging data to solve problems, optimize processes, and contribute to organizational success.

​I began my career in supply chain management, where I developed a strong understanding of operations, logistics, and process efficiency. Over time, I found myself drawn to the data behind the decisions—analyzing trends, identifying bottlenecks, and uncovering opportunities for improvement. That curiosity led me to transition into analytics, where I now focus on turning raw data into actionable insights that support strategic business outcomes.

This is a repository to showcase my skills and share projects in data analytics / data science related topics.
